# 8-core CPU unlock on Bazzite (runtime, no BIOS flash) — tested

The BC-250 ships with 6 of its 8 Zen 2 cores active. The other two aren't fused off. They're
masked by an SMU register (`SMN 0x0115A870`: `0x77` → `0xFF`), one core per CCX. The full
background is on the [community page](https://elektricm.github.io/amd-bc250-docs/system/8core-unlock/).
This page is **what we did and measured on our board** (Oct 2026), using the same live-manager
script as the [40 CU guide](bazzite-40cu-runtime-umr.md).

> ← Back to the [hub README](../README.md). Combine with the
> [CPU ACPI fix](cpu-acpi-fix-bazzite.md). With 8 cores you need its **16-thread** tables
> (see below), or the two new cores get no frequency scaling and no idle states.

## How it behaves (read first)

- **Warm reboot keeps it, cold boot loses it.** `systemctl reboot` keeps the unlock. Power-off,
  PSU switch or unplug reverts the mask to `0x77`, so you're back on 6 cores. Nothing is
  written to flash, so cutting power is a guaranteed way back to stock. To make it stick across
  cold boots without flashing anything, see the
  [re-apply service](#surviving-cold-boots-a-re-apply-service-that-never-reboots).
- **It needs a reboot to show up.** The mask is written live, but firmware only enumerates the
  extra cores on the next (warm) boot.
- **The GPU governor has to be stopped during the SMU access.** Both use the same index/data
  pair on `00:00.0`. The live-manager script does this for you (it stops and restarts
  `cyan-skillfish-governor-smu`).
- **Don't automate the reboot.** The community documented a bootloop with an older tool that
  rebooted on its own. The live-manager script never reboots with `--yes`; it only tells you to.

## Steps

```bash
# 1) Read the mask without writing (stops/restarts the GPU governor around the read)
sudo ~/bc250-cu-live-manager.sh cpu-unlock --dry-run
#   [ OK ] core presence mask: 0x00000077          <- the script aborts on any other value

# 2) Write it
sudo ~/bc250-cu-live-manager.sh cpu-unlock --yes
#   [ OK ] core mask after write: 0x000000ff
#   [ OK ] reboot when ready to bring up all 8 cores (16 threads)

# 3) Warm reboot (NOT power-off)
sudo systemctl reboot

# 4) Verify
lscpu | grep -E '^CPU\(s\)|Core\(s\) per socket'      # 16 / 8
sudo ~/bc250-cu-live-manager.sh status | grep 'CPU '  # 16 threads present, 16 online; unlocked 8c/16t
```

Some boards don't read `0x77` (`0xB7` and `0xD7` have been reported). The script refuses to
write an unexpected mask. Ours was the standard `0x77`.

## ACPI tables: switch to the 16-thread set

With the 6-core [ACPI fix](cpu-acpi-fix-bazzite.md) installed, the new cores (CPUs 12–15 = cores
6 and 7 on our board) came up with **no `cpufreq` and no `cpuidle`**, so you can't cap them and
they can't sleep. [mendesrr/bc250-acpi-fix-updated-8c](https://github.com/mendesrr/bc250-acpi-fix-updated-8c)
extends both tables to `\_PR.P00F` (same P-state table). It works **on both 6 and 8 cores**,
which matters because a cold boot drops you back to 6.

On the rpm-ostree setup from the ACPI page, overwrite the two files and rebuild the initramfs.
There's no "regenerate" flag, so disable and re-enable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mendesrr/bc250-acpi-fix-updated-8c.git
sudo cp bc250-acpi-fix-updated-8c/SSDT-CST.aml bc250-acpi-fix-updated-8c/SSDT-PST.aml /etc/dracut.conf.d/acpi/
sudo rpm-ostree initramfs --disable && sudo rpm-ostree initramfs --enable
sudo systemctl reboot        # warm reboot, keeps the 8 cores
```

Verified after the reboot: both SSDTs load from the initrd, and all 16 CPUs report `schedutil`
and 4 idle states.

## Surviving cold boots: a re-apply service that never reboots

The mask lives in the SMU's runtime state. Power-off clears it and the firmware writes `0x77`
back on the next power-on, which is why the unlock is lost. The safe way to make it stick
without flashing the BIOS is a boot service that **re-writes the mask but doesn't reboot**. The
cores then come up on the next reboot you do yourself. No double boot and no bootloop risk:
the service never triggers a reset, and with 16 threads already present it does nothing.

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/bc250-cpu-unlock.service
[Unit]
Description=BC-250: re-apply 8-core CPU unlock mask after a cold boot (active from the next reboot)
# Run before anything else that talks to the SMU through the 0xB8/0xBC index/data pair.
Before=cyan-skillfish-governor-smu.service bc250-cu-live-manager.service
ConditionPathExists=/usr/local/bin/bc250-cu-live-manager

[Service]
Type=oneshot
# 16 threads present -> no-op. Mask 0x77 -> writes 0xFF. Any other mask -> refuses, no write.
# Never reboots: the extra cores show up on the next (warm) reboot you choose.
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/bc250-cu-live-manager --yes cpu-unlock
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable bc250-cpu-unlock.service
```

It uses the copy of the live-manager that `install-service` puts in `/usr/local/bin` (see the
[40 CU guide](bazzite-40cu-runtime-umr.md#step-6--persist-across-reboots-optional)). `Before=` keeps
the GPU governor from starting until the SMU write is done.

**Tested on our board (Oct 2026), two full cycles:**

| Event | Threads | Service log |
|---|---|---|
| Running with 8 cores | 16 | `CPU cores are already unlocked and active (16 threads present)` |
| Power-off → power-on (cold) | 12 | `core presence mask: 0x00000077` → `core mask after write: 0x000000ff`, no reboot |
| Then `systemctl reboot` (warm) | **16** | `already unlocked` (no-op) |

Journal order on the cold boot: the unit finished at 13.68 s and the governor started at
13.70 s. The 40 CU service and the GPU governor came up normally in every boot.

After a cold boot, `status` shows `12 threads present` until you reboot once.

### Optional: a "reboot to enable 8 cores" notice (desktop + terminal)

So you don't have to remember that reboot, the service can leave a marker and you get asked at
login. Three small pieces:

1. **A marker in `/run`.** It's tmpfs, so it's gone after any reboot and only exists while the
   reboot is pending. A drop-in adds it after a successful unlock:

   ```bash
   # /usr/local/bin/bc250-cpu-unlock-flag  (chmod 755)
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   if [ "$(nproc --all)" -lt 16 ]; then
     mkdir -p /run/bc250 && echo pending > /run/bc250/cpu-unlock-pending
   else
     rm -f /run/bc250/cpu-unlock-pending
   fi
   ```
   ```ini
   # /etc/systemd/system/bc250-cpu-unlock.service.d/10-pending-flag.conf
   [Service]
   ExecStartPost=/usr/local/bin/bc250-cpu-unlock-flag
   ```
   (`ExecStartPost` only runs if `cpu-unlock` succeeded, so an unexpected mask leaves no marker.
   Keep the logic in a script: systemd treats `$` in unit files as its own variables.)

2. **A KDE notification with a button**, started at login via XDG autostart:

   ```bash
   # /usr/local/bin/bc250-cpu-unlock-notify  (chmod 755)
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   FLAG=/run/bc250/cpu-unlock-pending
   [ -f "$FLAG" ] || exit 0
   [ "$(nproc --all)" -ge 16 ] && exit 0
   sleep 8   # give the Plasma notification server time to start
   ans=$(notify-send --app-name="BC-250" --icon=system-reboot --urgency=critical \
     --action=reboot="Reiniciar ahora" --action=later="Más tarde" \
     "BC-250: 8 núcleos listos para activar" \
     "La CPU arrancó con $(nproc --all) hilos después de un apagado completo. La máscara de 8 núcleos ya está aplicada: reiniciá para activarlos.")
   [ "$ans" = reboot ] && exec systemctl reboot
   exit 0
   ```
   ```ini
   # /etc/xdg/autostart/bc250-cpu-unlock-notify.desktop
   [Desktop Entry]
   Type=Application
   Name=BC-250 8-core reboot notice
   Exec=/usr/local/bin/bc250-cpu-unlock-notify
   Icon=system-reboot
   NoDisplay=true
   X-KDE-autostart-phase=2
   ```
   `notify-send` ≥ 0.7.9 supports `--action` and blocks until you choose. `--urgency=critical`
   keeps it on screen in Plasma until you click. Notification servers that draw no buttons
   (Omarchy's) only run a `default` action on click; the
   [Omarchy page](omarchy-arch.md#8-core-unlock-re-apply-service-and-reboot-notice) has a
   version that works on both.

3. **A terminal prompt** for interactive shells (Konsole or SSH). It never shows in scripts or
   `ssh host cmd`, and it defaults to *No* after 20 s:

   ```bash
   # /etc/profile.d/bc250-cpu-unlock.sh
   if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ] && [ -f /run/bc250/cpu-unlock-pending ] && [ -t 0 ] && [ -t 1 ]; then
     case $- in *i*)
       if [ "$(nproc --all)" -lt 16 ]; then
         printf "\n\033[1;33m⚠  BC-250:\033[0m la CPU arrancó con %s hilos (apagado completo). La máscara de\n   8 núcleos ya está aplicada; falta un reinicio para activarlos.\n" "$(nproc --all)"
         read -r -t 20 -p "   ¿Reiniciar ahora? [s/N] " _bc250_ans || echo
         case "$_bc250_ans" in s|S|si|SI|sí|y|Y) systemctl reboot ;; *) echo "   Podés hacerlo después con: systemctl reboot" ;; esac
         unset _bc250_ans
       fi ;;
     esac
   fi
   ```

**Tested on our board (Oct 2026):** after a full power-off (woken via Wake-on-LAN), the marker
appeared with 12 threads. On login the Plasma notification showed both buttons. The terminal
prompt appeared in an interactive shell (answering *n* left it running and printed the
command), and nothing showed in a non-interactive `bash -lc`. Clicking **"Reiniciar ahora"**
rebooted the board into **16 threads** with no marker left. The board sits at the Plasma login
screen (no autologin), so the desktop notice appears once you log in. Game Mode sessions don't
show Plasma notifications; use the terminal prompt or `systemctl reboot` there.

> **Tip: power it on remotely.** Testing cold boots means someone has to press the power button,
> unless Wake-on-LAN is on. The BC-250's NIC supports it (`ethtool enp4s0` → `Supports Wake-on: …g`)
> and it woke from a full power-off on our board, but it ships disabled and an `ethtool -s … wol g`
> doesn't survive a reboot. Make it persistent through NetworkManager:
> ```bash
> sudo nmcli connection modify "$(nmcli -g GENERAL.CONNECTION device show enp4s0)" 802-3-ethernet.wake-on-lan magic
> sudo nmcli device reapply enp4s0
> ```
> Then send a magic packet to the board's MAC from another machine on the same LAN
> (`wakeonlan <mac>`, `etherwake`, or a few lines of PowerShell).

## Results (measured)

**Correctness first:** `stress-ng --cpu-method all --verify` passed 60 s on the new cores alone
(`taskset -c 12-15`, 4/4) and on all 16 threads (16/16). No machine-check errors in the kernel
log.

**7-Zip (`7z b`, same benchmark as the community page):**

| Config | Multi-thread | 1 thread | Package power | CPU peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 cores, boost | 40,185 MIPS | 3,883 | 64 W | 77 °C |
| **8 cores, boost** | **52,614 MIPS (+31 %)** | 3,918 | 73 W | 81 °C |
| 6 cores, cap 2550 MHz | 30,640 | 3,088 | 49 W | 62 °C |
| **8 cores, cap 2550 MHz** | **36,263** | 3,071 | 52 W | 62 °C |
| 8 cores, cap 1960 MHz | 31,267 | 2,527 | 49 W | 58 °C |

- +31 % multi-thread at stock clocks; single-thread unchanged.
- **8 cores capped at 2550 MHz ≈ 90 % of 6 cores with boost, for 12 W and 15 °C less.**
  8 cores at 1960 MHz beat 6 cores at 2550 MHz.
- Idle cost: none (42.1 W vs 42.5 W at 6 cores, with the 16-thread tables).

**CPU + GPU together** (`stress-ng` on all 16 threads + llama.cpp pp512 on the 40 CU GPU, the
closest thing to a heavy game):

| CPU setting | GPU pp512 | Package power | CPU avg / peak | GPU avg / peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| boost | 1042 tok/s | 127 W | 89 / **94 °C** | 73 / 83 °C |
| cap 2550 MHz | **1048 tok/s** | 117 W | 71 / 79 °C | 72 / 82 °C |

On our board (weak airflow, external fan), boosting all 8 cores under a combined load runs the
CPU within a degree of 95 °C. Capping at 2550 MHz drops it 15 °C and the GPU is, if anything,
slightly faster, because the CPU stops eating into the shared power budget.

**10-minute soaks, after improving the board's cooling** (Oct 18, on Omarchy; full table in the
[governor guide](governor-tuning.md#10-minute-soaks-the-heatsink-still-sets-the-ceiling)): the
cap still matters. Uncapped, the CPU held 3454 MHz without throttling itself and reached
**100 °C in 46 s**, so the test stopped it. Capped at 2550 MHz, the same load ran the full 10
minutes, steady at 87 °C. A 2000 MHz cap was only ~1 °C cooler than 2550 and did 23 % less CPU
work.

## Side effects

- **GPU frequency readouts break**, as the community page warns: `pp_dpm_sclk` shows `16Mhz`, the
  amdgpu hwmon `freq1_input` reads ~14 MHz, and `gpu_busy_percent` is empty. **It's monitoring
  only.** GPU throughput is unchanged (pp512 1071 tok/s at 8 cores) and the governor keeps
  working. Our [`sweep-clocks.sh`](../scripts/sweep-clocks.sh) sclk column is meaningless while
  8 cores are up. The governor has a `fix-freq` option aimed at this; we didn't need it.
- **The 40 CU unlock is unaffected**: 40/40, validate PASS.
- **Re-validate any CPU or GPU undervolt.** The community notes that 8 cores sag the shared rail
  more. We run stock voltages (see [why](governor-tuning.md#undervolting-test-for-wrong-answers-not-just-crashes)).

## Revert

Power the board off completely (not reboot) and you're back on 6 cores. The 16-thread ACPI
tables can stay; they're correct for 6 cores too. If you installed the re-apply service, disable
it first, or it will write the mask again on the next boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now bc250-cpu-unlock.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/bc250-cpu-unlock.service && sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl poweroff      # then power on: 6 cores
```
