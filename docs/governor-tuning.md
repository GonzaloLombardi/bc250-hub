# Governor & clock/voltage tuning on the BC-250 (cyan-skillfish-governor-smu)

The BC-250 has no usable stock power management on Linux — you run a userspace **governor**
that drives the SMU to set GPU frequency/voltage based on load. The de-facto choice on
Bazzite/Fedora is **[filippor/cyan-skillfish-governor](https://github.com/filippor/cyan-skillfish-governor)**
(SMU branch), packaged as `cyan-skillfish-governor-smu`.

> ← Back to the [hub README](../README.md). Pair this with the
> [40 CU unlock guide](bazzite-40cu-runtime-umr.md) — the numbers below are at **40 CU**.

## Install / status

```bash
# Bazzite / Fedora Atomic (rpm-ostree): layer it, then reboot
sudo rpm-ostree install cyan-skillfish-governor-smu
systemctl reboot

# Fedora (mutable): from the COPR
sudo dnf copr enable filippor/bazzite
sudo dnf install cyan-skillfish-governor-smu

# Arch: AUR package (by the governor's author)  →  yay -S cyan-skillfish-governor-smu  (or paru)
#   tested on Omarchy: see omarchy-arch.md
# Debian / others: a .deb or release tarball from GitHub Releases (see upstream README)

sudo systemctl enable --now cyan-skillfish-governor-smu.service
systemctl is-active cyan-skillfish-governor-smu
```

Config: **`/etc/cyan-skillfish-governor-smu/config.toml`** (world-readable). Apply changes
with `sudo systemctl restart cyan-skillfish-governor-smu`.

> The RPM marks the config `%config(noreplace)`. That means: **if you never edited it**, an
> upgrade replaces it with the new default (that's what happened on our board going to
> v0.4.14; the file gained `temp-read`). **If you did edit it**, your file is kept and the new

## Understanding `config.toml`

```toml
[gpu]
set-method = "smu"     # "smu" (drive the SMU directly) or "kernel"

[gpu-usage]
method = "busy-flag"   # "busy-flag", "process", or "kernel" (needs a patched kernel)
temp-read = "drm"      # "drm" or "sysfs": where the GPU temperature is read (v0.4.13+)
fix-freq = false       # work around unreliable sysfs freq readings (e.g. after 8-core unlock)

[dbus]
enabled = true         # runtime control via busctl / cyan-skillfish-performance-mode

[frequency-range]
min = 1000    # MHz — floor (500 is a shipped safe point and saves ~10 W idle, see below)
max = 1850    # MHz — ceiling (omit the key for no limit; do NOT set 0, see below)

[load-target]
upper = 0.65  # ramp up above 65% busy
lower = 0.50  # ramp down below 50% busy

[temperature]
throttling = 85           # °C — hard safety: clock down when hit
throttling_recovery = 75  # °C — resume when back under

# Frequency → voltage curve. Voltage is interpolated linearly between points.
[[safe-points]]
frequency = 1500
voltage = 900
[[safe-points]]
frequency = 1700
voltage = 920
[[safe-points]]
frequency = 1850
voltage = 930
# ... up to 2000 / 960 (plus commented-out points up to 2400 / 1150 in the shipped file)
```

Key ideas:
- **`safe-points`** define the voltage curve and its span. Since v0.4.11
  ([`606f5ce`](https://github.com/filippor/cyan-skillfish-governor/commit/606f5ce)) the governor
  **interpolates linearly** between neighbouring points, so a frequency between 1700 and
  1850 MHz gets a voltage between 920 and 930 mV. Older versions only used the listed pairs.
  Lowering a point's `voltage` undervolts that whole segment of the curve: cooler and less
  power, but unstable if you go too far. Frequencies outside the first and last point are
  rejected.
- **`frequency-range.max`** is your real ceiling. Raising it lets the governor climb further
  up the curve under load. The range is clamped to the span of the safe-points. **Don't set
  `max = 0`** expecting "no limit" (the shipped file's own comment still says you can): it gets
  clamped up to the lowest safe point and pins the GPU there. Tested on v0.4.14: the log shows an
  inverted `initial frequency range: 1000..=500`, the clock stays at **500 MHz even under load**,
  and pp512 drops from 1072 to **305 tok/s**. Omit the key instead.
- **`temperature.throttling`** is the governor's safety net. Leave it on (85 °C is sane) even
  while experimenting. Until the governor *service* is enabled, any crash reboots to stock clocks.
- **There's a second, lower limit:** with `set-method = "smu"` the governor also sets the SMU's
  own GPU temperature limit to **80 °C** at startup (`set_gpu_max_temperature(80)` in
  `src/gpu.rs`, added Feb 2026; builds from older sources, like our June `g7f91021` one, don't
  set it). **Don't count on it as a cap:** in our October sweep on v0.4.14 the edge sensor went
  to 91 °C, and the clock only dipped slightly (avg 1981 MHz at a 2000 MHz pin). That's consistent
  with the governor's own 85 °C throttle, with no sign of a hard 80 °C firmware limit. What the
  SMU does with that value isn't documented. If you also run
  [bc250_smu_oc](https://github.com/bc250-collective/bc250_smu_oc), note that it writes its own
  SMU temperature limit (90 °C by default), and whichever tool runs last wins.

## Measured sweep (40 CU, Bazzite 44)

**October 2026 run** (Bazzite `44.20260929`, kernel 7.2.7, Mesa 26.2.2, governor **v0.4.14**,
default curve). Each frequency was pinned with `cyan-skillfish-performance-mode
--fixed-frequency F`, then `llama-bench -p 512 -r 10` (Qwen2.5-3B Q4_K_M, llama.cpp `b9538`)
ran at 40 CU. Sensors were sampled every 0.5 s **during** the load: averages are over the
loaded samples, and peaks are the max. Between points the board cooled in adaptive mode.
Reproduce it on your board with [`scripts/sweep-clocks.sh`](../scripts/sweep-clocks.sh) (no root
needed).

| Freq | pp512 (tok/s) | Avg sclk | Avg vddgfx | Temp avg / peak | PPT avg / peak | tok/s per W |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1500 MHz | 881 | 1500 | 874 mV | 78 / 80 °C | 115 / 122 W | 7.65 |
| 1700 MHz | 992 | 1700 | 887 mV | 83 / 84 °C | 128 / 142 W | **7.74** |
| 1850 MHz | 1068 | 1842 | 897 mV | 85 / 86 °C | 142 / 147 W | 7.54 |
| 2000 MHz | 1140 | 1981 | 919 mV | 89 / **91 °C** | 158 / 168 W | 7.21 |

How to read it:
- **Throughput matches June within 1 %** at every point (873/983/1062/1144 then). Four
  months of kernel, Mesa and governor updates changed nothing on the compute side.
- **PPT is package power (CPU + GPU)**, so it isn't only the GPU (loading all CPU threads adds
  ~34 W). The board idles at ~43 W package (~33 W with a
  [500 MHz floor](#lowering-the-floor-to-500-mhz-10-w-less-at-idle)) with or without the
  [CPU ACPI fix](cpu-acpi-fix-bazzite.md). The sweep ran before the fix, but the fix changes
  neither idle power nor GPU-bound results.
- **`vddgfx` reads below the safe-point voltages** (e.g. 919 mV at 2000 MHz vs a 960 mV
  point). The SMU applies its own offset under load. Judge undervolts by stability, not by
  this readout.
- **The temperatures are the outlier, and that's cooling.** At 2000 MHz the June run peaked
  at 161 W and 73 °C. This one peaked at 168 W and **91 °C**: almost the same power, +18 °C.
  Same board, same clocks, but with an idle GPU at 63 °C, motherboard "System" sensor at 57 °C
  and VRM at 57 °C *before* any load, which points at case airflow (and a warmer season). At
  1850 and 2000 MHz the governor's 85 °C throttle trims the clock slightly (avg sclk 1842 /
  1981). Here is the ❄️ note below, demonstrated on one board.

<details>
<summary>June 2026 run (governor built from <code>g7f91021</code>, mixed methodology)</summary>

| Freq cap | pp512 (tok/s) | Voltage | Temp | Power | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1500 MHz | 873 | 837 mV | 53 °C | 53 W | post-run steady |
| 1700 MHz | 983 | 912 mV | 57 °C | 64 W | post-run steady |
| 1850 MHz | 1062 | 918 mV | 60 °C | 80 W | post-run steady |
| 2000 MHz | 1144 | 960 mV | 73 °C peak | ~161 W peak | live peak sampling, no throttle |

The 1500–1850 rows were read *after* each run, so their power/temp undershoot the load values.
Only the 2000 MHz row was sampled live. Don't compare those rows with the October table.
</details>

> ### ❄️ Everything here is cooling-dependent
>
> These temps reflect **one specific board + cooling setup**. The BC-250's thermals vary
> enormously with airflow, heatsink/fan, paste, ambient, and case. A board that hits 73 °C at
> 2000 MHz on good cooling can hit **90–96 °C** (community-reported) on weak cooling — same
> registers, same clocks. **Treat the numbers above as *your* potential ceiling only after you
> measure your own board.** Improving cooling is usually the highest-leverage change: it's what
> turns "2000 MHz throttles/crashes" into "2000 MHz runs cool." Always keep `throttling = 85`
> on and watch temps live the first time you push clocks.

**Takeaways:**
- Throughput scales **almost linearly** with frequency (1500 → 2000 MHz: +33 % clock →
  +29 % tok/s).
- **Power scales a bit faster than performance.** Each step up buys ~7–13 % throughput for
  ~10–12 % more package power. **1700 MHz has the best tok/s per watt**, but the spread is
  small (7.2–7.7). Pick by temperature as much as by efficiency.
- **Temperature is what decides the ceiling, and it depends on your cooling.** With good
  airflow (June) the whole range stayed ≤ 73 °C. With poor airflow (October) 1850 already sits
  at the 85 °C throttle and 2000 MHz overshoots to 91 °C. The 40 CU unlock adds load, so
  check yours.

> Note: combine this with the unlock — at a *fixed* clock, going 24 → 40 CU is the larger
> win (≈1.55× from the [unlock benchmark](bazzite-40cu-runtime-umr.md#step-5--verify-it-does-real-work-benchmark));
> clock tuning is the second-order knob on top.

## Sustained loads after a cooling upgrade (10-minute soaks)

**Oct 18 2026, Omarchy** (kernel 7.2.5, governor v0.4.14 with `min = 500`, `max = 1850`,
`throttling = 85` / `throttling_recovery = 75`), 40 CU + 8 cores, llama.cpp `b11382`,
Qwen2.5-3B Q4_K_M. Same board as the tables above, after improving its cooling. Package power
(PPT) is CPU + GPU.

### Short benchmarks: 15–20 °C cooler, same speed

| Test | Before | After the upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| Idle (500 MHz floor), GPU edge / CPU Tctl | 53–54 / 55–56 °C, 33.5 W | **37 / 39 °C**, 31.6 W |
| 7-Zip `7z b`, 16 threads uncapped | 66,377 MIPS | 66,211 MIPS, CPU peak **66 °C** |
| Fixed 1500 MHz, pp512 / temp avg–peak | 879 / 78–80 °C | 884 / **57–59 °C** |
| Fixed 1700 MHz | 990 / 83–84 °C | 995 / **63–64 °C** |
| Fixed 1850 MHz | 1064 / 85–86 °C | 1075 / **67–69 °C** |
| Fixed 2000 MHz | 1137 / 89–91 °C | **1155** / **73–74 °C** |

The "before" pp512 numbers are the Omarchy runs; the "before" temperatures are the October
Bazzite sweep above (the Omarchy sweep didn't log them) and the idle row is the
[500 MHz floor](#lowering-the-floor-to-500-mhz-10-w-less-at-idle) measurement. The 7-Zip
score didn't move because nothing was throttling it. The only speed gain is at 2000 MHz
(+1.6 %), which no longer reaches the 85 °C throttle within a 10-rep run.

### 10-minute soaks: the heatsink still sets the ceiling

Short runs end before the heatsink saturates. We ran each load for 10 minutes with
[`scripts/soak-test.sh`](../scripts/soak-test.sh) (pp512 back to back, stress-ng on all 16
threads when the CPU is loaded, hard stop at 100 °C). "Steady" is the average of minutes 5–10.

| GPU | CPU | pp512 first min → steady | CPU work (stress-ng bogo ops/s) | Steady Tctl / edge (edge peak) | Steady PPT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adaptive | idle | 1074 → **913** | — | 86.7 / 83.9 °C (90) | 113 W |
| adaptive | uncapped | 1060 → **stopped at 46 s, Tctl 100 °C** | — | still climbing ~1 °C/s | 154 W avg, 182 W peak |
| adaptive | cap 2550 | 1053 → **869** | ≈12,600 ¹ | 87.0 / 83.6 °C (90) | 117 W |
| fixed 1700 | cap 2000 | 969 → 910 | 9,647 | 89.0 / 86.1 °C (91) | 119 W |
| fixed 1700 | cap 2550 | 976 → 892 | 12,621 | 89.6 / 86.7 °C (92) | 121 W |
| fixed 1850 | cap 2000 | 1046 → **944** | 9,669 | 90.8 / 87.7 °C (93) | 125 W |
| **fixed 1850** | **cap 2550** | 1054 → **924** | **12,633** | **91.8 / 88.6 °C (95)** | 126 W |

¹ Not logged in that run; the same 2550 MHz cap gave 12,621–12,633 in every other run, and the
CPU held 2544 MHz throughout.

What it shows:
- **The upgrade buys time, not a higher sustained ceiling.** GPU-only at the adaptive default
  runs at full speed for ~100 s, then the GPU edge reaches 85 °C and throughput settles 15 %
  lower (~1074 → ~913 tok/s). The board heat-soaks at ~110–125 W whatever the clocks.
- **Uncapped CPU + GPU is not sustainable.** The CPU never throttled itself (3454 MHz average)
  and reached 100 °C in 46 s. The [2550 MHz cap](cpu-8core-unlock-bazzite.md#results-measured)
  is required for combined loads, even with the better cooling.
- **Pinning the GPU sustains more than the adaptive mode at the same 1850 MHz ceiling:**
  924 vs 869 tok/s with the CPU loaded (+6 %). It isn't free. In pinned mode the throttle only
  trims the clock (pp512 cycles between ~1010, ~925 and ~835 tok/s), while the adaptive mode
  backs off further (its recovery point is `throttling_recovery = 75`). So the pinned runs sit ~5 °C hotter (edge 88.6 vs
  83.6 °C average, 95 vs 90 °C peak).
- **Capping the CPU at 2000 instead of 2550 MHz barely helps the GPU** (+2 % at 1850 MHz, +2 %
  at 1700 MHz) and costs 23 % of the CPU's work. Temperatures drop only ~1 °C, because the
  shared heatsink is what's saturated.
- **A loaded CPU costs the GPU ~5 % sustained** (913 → 869 tok/s, both adaptive).

These are worst cases: stress-ng on 16 threads plus back-to-back compute. Games load both sides
less, so they settle later and cooler.

## How to pin a frequency for benchmarking

The governor is load-adaptive, so to measure a single clock cleanly you need to hold it fixed.

**Easiest (current versions, D-Bus enabled):** use the performance-mode helper. Thermal
throttling stays active, and no config edit or restart is needed:

```bash
cyan-skillfish-performance-mode --fixed-frequency 1700   # pin
cyan-skillfish-performance-mode --status
cyan-skillfish-performance-mode --off                    # back to adaptive
```

The raw equivalents (tested) are
`busctl --system call com.cyanskillfish.Governor /com/cyanskillfish/Governor com.cyanskillfish.Governor.PerformanceMode SetFixedFrequency u 1700`
and, to turn it off,
`busctl --system set-property com.cyanskillfish.Governor /com/cyanskillfish/Governor com.cyanskillfish.Governor.PerformanceMode Enabled b false`.

> ⚠️ **Wrapper mode doesn't clean up (v0.4.14).** Upstream documents
> `cyan-skillfish-performance-mode --fixed-frequency 1700 -- some-command` as "enable, run,
> disable on exit", but the script sets `trap cleanup EXIT` and then `exec`s the command, and
> `exec` replaces the shell, so the trap never runs. On our board the clock **stayed pinned**
> after the wrapped command exited, with or without `--`, whether it succeeded or failed. If
> you use the wrapper (e.g. as a Steam launch option), run `--off` afterwards, or a pinned
> clock will keep the GPU hot at idle.

**Config-file method** (how the June sweep was measured; works on any version): set
`min = max`:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^\s*min = .*/min = 1700/; s/^\s*max = .*/max = 1700/' \
  /etc/cyan-skillfish-governor-smu/config.toml
sudo systemctl restart cyan-skillfish-governor-smu
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/freq1_input   # confirm it's holding (Hz)
```

Restore your range (e.g. `min = 1000`, `max = 1850`) and restart when done. Note that sysfs
frequency readings on this board can be unreliable (see `fix-freq` above). Watch live:

```bash
HW=$(for h in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*; do grep -qi amdgpu "$h/name" && echo "$h"; done)
watch -n1 'echo "$(($(cat '"$HW"'/temp1_input)/1000))C $(($(cat '"$HW"'/power1_average)/1000000))W $(($(cat '"$HW"'/freq1_input)/1000000))MHz"'
```

---

## Going to 2000 MHz (the top safe-point)

The default config already ships a `2000 MHz / 960 mV` safe-point — the unlock doesn't cap
your clocks, so **whether to use it is entirely your decision**. It's the highest-throughput
setting (**~1140 tok/s here, ~1.07× over 1850 MHz**), at the cost of meaningfully more heat and
power (package peak ~165 W). Our own board shows both sides. In June, with good airflow, it held
a flat 2000 MHz at **73 °C peak**. In October, with poor airflow, it hit **91 °C** and the
governor had to throttle it a little. Community boards with weak cooling report ~90–96 °C too.
Same registers, wildly different temps: it's a "know your cooling + monitor" setting, not
fire-and-forget.

To raise the ceiling so the governor can reach 2000 MHz under load:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^\s*max = .*/max = 2000/' /etc/cyan-skillfish-governor-smu/config.toml
sudo systemctl restart cyan-skillfish-governor-smu
```

Then **stress-test while watching temps live** (use the `watch` one-liner above, or the
`llama-bench` loop from the unlock guide). The `throttling = 85` line is your safety net: it
clocks down before things get dangerous. It reacts, so expect a few degrees of overshoot
(91 °C peak in our hot run). Recommended checks before keeping it:

- Temp stays below your comfort threshold under sustained load (the 85 °C throttle is a
  ceiling, not a target — many prefer to keep peaks in the low 80s).
- No GPU resets/crashes in `dmesg` during a stress run.
- If unstable, either drop `max` back to 1850, or nudge the 2000 MHz safe-point's `voltage`
  up a touch (e.g. 960 → 970 mV) for more headroom. With interpolation, that also raises the
  voltage for everything between 1850 and 2000 MHz.
- The shipped config has commented-out points above 2000 MHz (up to 2400 MHz / 1150 mV). Those
  go beyond what this doc measured. Don't uncomment them without serious cooling, and never
  exceed what upstream lists.

Revert anytime: set `max` back to `1850` (or `1700`) and restart the service.

## Undervolting: test for wrong answers, not just crashes

The usual advice is "lower the voltage until it crashes, then back off". On our board that would
have been dangerous: **the first failure was silent.** At 1850 MHz, 890 mV benchmarked at full
speed with a clean `dmesg`, but a deterministic llama.cpp generation (temp 0, fixed seed)
produced **different text** than at stock voltage. The GPU was computing wrong results without
any sign of trouble.

Measured with [`scripts/undervolt-test.sh`](../scripts/undervolt-test.sh) (governor TestMode,
no config edits; Oct 2026, governor v0.4.14):

| 1850 MHz @ | pp512 (tok/s) | Avg vddgfx | Package power | Same output as stock? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 930 mV (shipped) | 1072 | 900 mV | 130–136 W | ✅ reference |
| 910 mV | 1071 | 881–887 mV | 133–137 W | ✅ 3 of 3 runs |
| 890 mV | 1071 | 856–858 mV | 115–133 W | ❌ **2 of 2 runs mismatched** (no crash, no dmesg errors) |

Takeaways for this board:
- **The shipped curve has very little margin:** just 20 mV between the default and silent
  miscompute.
- **The one safe step (−20 mV) saved nothing measurable** in package power or temperature, so
  it isn't worth the risk. We left the shipped voltages alone.
- If you undervolt yours, check correctness and not only stability: compare a deterministic
  output, or use the script above, which stops at the first mismatch. Keep at least one passing
  step of margin below the value you settle on.

## Lowering the floor to 500 MHz (10 W less at idle)

The shipped config sets `min = 1000`, but the voltage curve starts lower: its first safe point is
**500 MHz / 700 mV**. Letting the governor use it is the biggest idle saving we've found on this
board.

**Measured (Oct 2026, Omarchy, 40 CU + 8 cores, governor v0.4.14):** idle, desktop logged in,
floor alternated 1000 → 500 → 1000 → 500 so drift can't fake the result. 30 s to settle, then
180 s of 1 s samples each:

| Floor | Package power (avg / min) | vddgfx | GPU edge | CPU Tctl |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1000 MHz | 43.7 / 42.5 W | 793 mV | 58.3 °C | 59.5 °C |
| **500 MHz** | **33.6 / 32.6 W** | 699 mV | 53.9 °C | 56.1 °C |
| 1000 MHz | 42.7 / 41.6 W | 793 mV | 56.4 °C | 57.4 °C |
| **500 MHz** | **33.4 / 32.5 W** | 699 mV | 53.1 °C | 55.2 °C |

| llama.cpp `b11382` | Floor 1000 | Floor 500 |
|---|---|---|
| pp512 | 1073.2 tok/s | 1073.4 tok/s |
| tg128 | 141.0 tok/s | 140.4 tok/s |

- **−9.7 W at idle (−22 %)** and 3–4 °C cooler, with no throughput loss: the governor ramps up
  under load just as before.
- **It isn't an undervolt.** 500 MHz / 700 mV is a shipped safe point; the stock `min` just never
  let the governor reach it.
- **Not measured:** how the desktop feels (a longer ramp from 500 MHz could show up as a short
  stutter when something starts). We didn't notice one, but we didn't test for it either.
- **It should apply to Bazzite too.** The governor, version and config are the same, and the idle
  power at 1000 MHz matched within 0.4 W, but we only measured the 500 MHz floor on Omarchy.

Try it at runtime first, without root, through D-Bus (it resets when the governor restarts):

```bash
busctl --system set-property com.cyanskillfish.Governor \
  /com/cyanskillfish/Governor/Range/Current com.cyanskillfish.Governor.Range Min u 500
```

Then make it permanent:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^min = 1000\b/min = 500/' /etc/cyan-skillfish-governor-smu/config.toml
sudo systemctl restart cyan-skillfish-governor-smu
```

## Recommended starting point

- **Floor: `min = 500`** ([above](#lowering-the-floor-to-500-mhz-10-w-less-at-idle)): ~10 W
  less at idle, same throughput.
- **Efficiency:** `max = 1700` (best tok/s per watt) — ~87 % of peak throughput. On a board
  with poor airflow it's also the highest point that stays clear of the 85 °C throttle (83 °C
  avg in our hot run).
- **Balanced:** `max = 1850` (the shipped default) — ~94 % of peak. Fine with decent cooling
  (≤ 60 °C in June); it sits right at the throttle threshold when airflow is poor.
- **Max performance:** `max = 2000` — highest throughput, runs hot (~90 °C on weak cooling);
  your call, with cooling + monitoring (see [Going to 2000 MHz](#going-to-2000-mhz-the-top-safe-point)).
- **Long CPU + GPU loads (8 cores):** cap the CPU at 2550 MHz, always. For the most sustained
  GPU throughput, run the load through `cyan-skillfish-performance-mode --fixed-frequency 1850`
  (it works as a Steam launch-option wrapper): +6 % over the adaptive mode after 10 minutes, at
  ~5 °C more ([soaks above](#10-minute-soaks-the-heatsink-still-sets-the-ceiling)).
- If your board idles hot (GPU edge above ~60 °C, motherboard "System" sensor above ~50 °C),
  **fix the airflow before tuning clocks**. It's worth more than any safe-point tweak.
- Keep `throttling = 85` on at every tier.
- **Undervolt cautiously, if at all:** drop a safe-point's `voltage` by 10–20 mV at a time, and
  test for **wrong output**, not just crashes (see [above](#undervolting-test-for-wrong-answers-not-just-crashes)).
  On our board it gave no measurable benefit before outputs went wrong.
- Enable the service so settings persist: `sudo systemctl enable cyan-skillfish-governor-smu`.

*No warranty. Undervolting/overclocking can crash the GPU; keep `throttling` on and a remote
shell handy.*
